# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to assist a ride sharing company called "PyBer" in analyzing and visualizing some data to help them improve access and affordibility of their ride share services. We will analyze the data based on the total riders, total drivers and total fares grouping by different city types.
## Results
### Total Rides
The total rides are highest in the urban cities and lowest in rural cities. This shows us that in higher populated areas like Urban Cities more ride share services are being used. The total rides are outlined in the table below:

### Total Drivers
The total drivers data also shows us that there are more drivers in urban cities and the lowest in rural cities. This could mean there is less demand for drivers in urban cities or more drivers prefer to complete rides in urban cities. The total drivers are outlined in the table below:

### Total Fares
The total fares follow the same pattern where the urban cities total fares are significantly higher and the rural cities total fares are the lowest. This could be due to the total number of rides and drivers being higher in urban cities and the lowest in rural or it could be that the price of rides in Urban cities is higher. The total fares are outlined in the table below:
