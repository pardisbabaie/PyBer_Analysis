# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to assist a ride sharing company called "PyBer" in analyzing and visualizing some data to help them improve access and affordibility of their ride share services. We will analyze the data based on the total riders, total drivers and total fares grouping by different city types.
## Results
### Total Rides
The total rides are highest in the urban cities and lowest in rural cities. This shows us that in higher populated areas like Urban Cities more ride share services are being used. The total rides are outlined in the table below:

### Total Drivers
The total drivers data also shows us that there are more drivers in urban cities and the lowest in rural cities. This could mean there is less demand for drivers in urban cities or more drivers prefer to complete rides in urban cities. The total drivers are outlined in the table below:

### Total Fares
The total fares follow the same pattern where the urban cities total fares are significantly higher and the rural cities total fares are the lowest. This could be due to the total number of rides and drivers being higher in urban cities and the lowest in rural or it could be that the price of rides in Urban cities is higher. The total fares are outlined in the table below:

### Average Fare per Ride
The average fares per ride data results show that the fares in the urban cities are lower than both suburban and rural cities. Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride. This demonstrates that the total fares being higher in urban cities is not because of the average fare per ride but likely because of the total rides and drivers being higher. The average fares per rides are outlined in the table below:


### Average Fare per Driver
The average fares per driver data results also show that the fares in the urban cities are the lowest and the average fares per driver in rural cities are the highest. This also solidifies that the reason for the total fares being higher in urban cities has to do with the total rides and total fares being higher. The average fares per driver are outlined in the table below:
