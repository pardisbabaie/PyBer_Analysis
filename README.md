# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to assist a ride sharing company called "PyBer" in analyzing and visualizing some data to help them improve access and affordibility of their ride share services. We will analyze the data based on the total riders, total drivers and total fares grouping by different city types.
